# Hate Speech Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated hate speech detection system for online platforms. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to effectively identify and filter hate speech from user-generated content, contributing to a safer and more inclusive online environment.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected from various online platforms. It contains labeled examples of hate speech, offensive language, and benign content. The dataset is available in the repo.

## Approach
The project follows these main steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text data using techniques like CountVectorizer.
3. Model Training: Training machine learning models, such as decision trees or neural networks, on the labeled dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a web application or API for real-time hate speech detection.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit (for deployment)
